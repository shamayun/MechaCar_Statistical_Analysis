# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
 Statistical study to compare vehicle performance Using R & RStudio
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the
competition. 

In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few
examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating

What metric or metrics are you going to test?

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
